Description: For single tensor data, any matrix factorization method can be specified the matricised tensor in each dimension by Multi-way Component Analysis (MWCA). An originally extended MWCA is also implemented to specify and decompose multiple matrices and tensors simultaneously (CoupledMWCA). See the reference section of GitHub README.md <https://github.com/rikenbit/mwTensor>, for details of the methods.
